        <p><strong>Early life: </strong> In 1880 Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani was born in Dhangara village in Sirajganj, Bengal Presidency.[citation needed] He was the son of Sharafat Ali Khan. Between 1907 and 1909 he received religious education at the Deoband Madrasah</p>
    
        <p><strong>Political career: </strong>In 1917, Bhashani was inducted into active politics and joined the Nationalist party led by Desbandhu Chittaranjan Das as an activist. Inspired by Mohammed Ali, he joined the Indian National Congress in 1919. In 1920 he was arrested and imprisoned.</p>
    
        <p><strong>War of Independence 1971: </strong>Moulana Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani was the Chairman of Sorbodoliyo Songram Parisad in 1971. He has seen the dream of Bangladesh. Bhashani asked China to aid Bangladesh in the liberation war. His request was not answered by China.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Career in independent Bangladesh: </strong>Bhashani wanted to play the role of a responsible opposition. The progressive forces quickly gathered around him and strengthened his NAP with Kazi Zafar Ahmed as its General Secretary.</p>
    
        <p><strong>Political philosophy: </strong>In the early 1950s he felt that an integrated Pakistan was no longer maintainable with hegemony of West Pakistan. At the Kagmari Conference, he bade farewell to West Pakistan by saying Assalamu Alaikum which soon became a reference quote.</p>
